### ðŸ”¹ **Cyber Threat Intelligence Telegram Bot - Credential Risk Assessment Tool**
Developed an AI-driven tool to assess the risk associated with credentials detected by a Telegram scraping bot.
- Conducted in-depth data engineering research, including feature selection, data collection, and preprocessing to build a high-quality dataset.
- Designed, trained, and evaluated a Machine Learning model to enhance risk assessment accuracy.
- Deployed the AI tool in a web-based triage system, enabling automated risk classification and visualization of credential threats.

_Presented the project at the [CNN-CERT (National Cryptologic Center) Cyberdefense Conference](/conferences)_
